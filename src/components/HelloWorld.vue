  <div class="hello">
La La La

La La La

I'm an expert in selling newspapers

Wait till dawn for the newspaper

Go on

Yelling

Today's news is really good

Seven coppers buy two newspapers

La La La

La La La

I'm an expert in selling newspapers

Running all over the street in strong wind and heavy rain

I can't walk well

Slip and fall

The muddy water makes people laugh

Hunger and cold only I know

La La La

La La La

I'm an expert in selling newspapers

Running all over the street with hunger and cold tolerance

be on short commons

can't sleep well

Who does the painful life tell

One day the light will come
